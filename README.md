80-ish
======

Web-based CPU/Computer simulator loosely for educational purposes loosely based on the hardware of the '80s.

More precisely: 80-ish tries to simulate a a Z80 computer with 1k main memory, boiled down to the
essentials. Meaning: All programs developed via 80-ish should run on an actual Z80, but not the other
way round as not all Z80 instructions are implemented.
